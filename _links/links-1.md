### [Is cost optimization “Good Housekeeping” or not?](http://www.cloudbombe.com/blog/qa-engineering-action/)
(From Mike Bradbury at the FinOps Foundation) First off this post is just scratching the surface of some fairly tough subjects and to attempt to answer them in a single blog post is admirable but probably probably missing out on some of the nuance. Regardless there are definitely some good thoughts here to consider especially in the second point.

### [Four lessons in cloud sourcing and consumption](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unlocking-value-four-lessons-in-cloud-sourcing-and-consumption)
(Credit goes to Joe Daly for finding this) As follows:

* Sourcing and managing consumption of the cloud is a dynamic exercise: constant review is needed to determine if the assets in use are useful
* Cloud economics is a demand rather than supply game: because there is so much more flexibility in CSPs than in the traditional data center
* Granular visibility and forecasting are needed to optimize consumption of the cloud: another case for tagging, and why it’s important to derive unit-cost economics
* Cross-functional FinOps is essential to manage cloud sourcing and consumption: empowering this team to affect change is the key component

### [AWS Cloud Economics: Where Every Dollar Counts](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-cloud-economics-where-every-dollar-counts/)
This post seemed to be more of a recruiting tool for Cognizant than anything, but there are some gems in here: the [Cognizant Cloud Steps Transformation Framework](https://www.cognizant.com/services-resources/Services/cognizant-cloud-steps-transformation.pdf) is much better filled out than the “Three Rs” framework we know and somewhat love, puts emphasis on tagging, considers network and architecture limits, and (my favorite) promotes FaaS and containers.

### [Operating Lambda: Logging and custom metrics](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/operating-lambda-logging-and-custom-metrics/)

### [Rethinking ‘rehost, replatform, rearchitect’: Cloud migration for the real world](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/cloud-migration/real-world-cloud-migration-strategies)
I’ve long been highly skeptical of the <Dr Evil Quotes>simplicity</Dr Evil Quotes> behind ‘rehost, replatform, rearchitect’, and this post from a CSP actually shores some of that up. It breaks it down into two primary yet expansive categories that are much more philosophical than prescriptive.
