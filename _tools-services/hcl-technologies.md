product-overview: |
  FinOps at HCLTech is a framework that focuses on equating cost to the need in cloud operations. We aim to bring consistency, visibility, and control throughout cloud operations through FinOps. To support the three iterative stages of FinOps i.e., inform, optimize, and govern, we follow a 6-point approach -

  1) Cloud Visibility

  2) Optimization & Allocation

  3) Scheduling & Analytics

  4) Tag Management

  5) Governance & Reporting

  6) Security & Health

  We ensure real time visibility of cost and consumption and provide recommendations on optimization. Our offerings are in the line of providing high touch concierge service, dedicated FinOps practitioner advocacy and guidance on account best practices, consultative reviews for cost optimization, instance rightsizing based on consumption trends, RI recommendations to increase savings, capacity analysis, inventory management, budget control, alert management, publishing reports, and ensuring specific security compliances.
