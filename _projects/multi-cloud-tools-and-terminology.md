# Multi-Cloud Tools and Terminology

## Abstract

Ensure that there are materials that help translate core tools and terminology concepts across multiple cloud service providers.

## Before you begin

You should understand the basics of how cloud computing works, know the key services on your cloud providers, including their common use cases, and have a basic understanding of billing and pricing models. Being able to describe the basic value proposition of running in the cloud and understand the core concept of using a pay-as-you-go consumption model are also necessary.

You'll also need to have a base level of knowledge of at least one of the three main public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). For AWS, we recommend AWS Business Professional training or, even better, the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. For Google, check out the Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals course. For Azure, try the Azure Fundamentals learning path. Each can usually be completed in a full day workshop.

<!-- ## Relevant FinOps Framework components
To get the most out of this document, please review the following first:
* [Tagging and labeling](/framework/archive/v0.1/capabilities/tagging-labeling/)
* [Cost allocation](/framework/archive/v0.1/domains/allocate/)
* [Accurate Cloud Forecasts](/framework/projects/accurate-cloud-forecasts/)
* Invoice and Billing Reporting
* Reserved Instances, spot pricing and savings plans
* [Organizational Alignment](/framework/domains/organizational-alignment/)

If you have a strong handle on these subjects, please continue on to better understand how to approach this challenge. -->

## FinOps Tools Matrix
Each Cloud Service Provider has different tools available to help FinOps practitioners learn and practice efficient utilization of cloud resources.  There are tools and reports available that can help FinOps practitioners and companies plan their potential cost in advance of consumption, understand invoices, complete billing analysis, govern cost and optimize cost.  These tools have been enumerated in the FinOps Tools Matrix.

## Cost Management Terminology
Cloud Service Providers utilize different terms to mean the same or similar things.  This can make understanding cloud concepts across providers difficult.  This terminology generated from this project was created to help FinOps practitioners translate these common terms across Cloud Service Providers and has been incorporated into [the FinOps Terminology page here](https://www.finops.org/resources/terminology/).


#### Three Letter Acronyms
Cloud cost management is not void of its own set of TLA's.  As a community the goal is to collect a list of three letter acronyms that are relevant and frequently used in daily cloud cost management.  

| TLA |	Meaning |
|---:|:---|
| AWS	| Amazon Web Services |
| CSP	| Cloud Service Provider |
| GCP	| Google Cloud Platform |
| KPI	| Key Performance Indicator |
| TAC	| Technical Advisory Council |
