## Unit costing: The next frontier in cloud FinOps

Whenever it can be implemented, unit costing will be the most effective means of managing and minimizing cloud expenses. With unit costing, a unit measure of consumption of cloud services can be measured per unit of production of a product or service. This practice is most effective at incentivizing efficiency and facilitates far more accurate budgeting and forecasting. As such, unit costing will become the standard by which FinOps practitioners obtain full business context for cloud costs.
