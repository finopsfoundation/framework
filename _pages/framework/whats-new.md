#### Chargeback & Finance Integration (Capability; Update)

#### FinOps Intersection with other Frameworks (Capability; Update)
the name for this Framework Capability was updated (_formerly:  IT Asset Management Integration_). the intention for updating this capability's name is to provide a place to capture FinOps' interaction with other processes and standards being used by your organization. the updated name clarifies this intention and allows for extending beyond ITAM to include ITFM, TBM, SAM, and Sustainability among others. ITAM plays an important role with FinOps and we will continue investing in the ITAM content here with future working-groups. see [this Capability's](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/asset-management/) Definition, Functional Activities, and Maturity Assessment sections for more details.
