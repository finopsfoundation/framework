#### FinOps & TBM Playbook (Resource; New)
this Framework resource provides a playbook to empower individuals who manage the value of cloud. it's an example of how navigating co-existing disciplines through [FinOps Intersection with other frameworks](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/asset-management/). this guide defines key terminology related to the intersection of FinOps and TBM, explains relevant taxonomy, and outlines capabilities that every practitioner must be familiar with. it explores common use cases where FinOps teams benefit from interaction with TBM teams as well as success stories and common pitfalls that teams may encounter when embarking on a joint endeavor. see [this Framework resource here](https://www.finops.org/projects/finops-tbm-navigating-coexisting-disciplines/) for more details.


&nbsp;

#### Establishing a FinOps Decision & Accountability Structure (Capability; New)
new core content has been added to this Framework Capability; including a new definition, an outline of persona driven activities, and maturity characteristics for assessing your FinOps practice at [each level in the FinOps maturity model](https://www.finops.org/framework/maturity-model/). see [this Capability's](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/decision-accountability-structure) Functional Activities, Maturity Assessment and Measures of Success sections for more details.


&nbsp;

#### Chargeback & Finance Integration (Capability; Update)
the name for this Framework Capability was updated (_formerly: Chargeback & IT Finance Integration_). the intention for updating this capability's name is to recognize your organizations financial reporting needs and considerations for how to consolidate cloud cost management data with all financial reporting data. see [this Capability's](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/chargeback/) Definition, Functional Activities, and Maturity Assessment sections for more details.

&nbsp;

#### FinOps Intersection with other Frameworks (Capability; Update)
the name for this Framework Capability was updated (_formerly:  IT Asset Management Integration_). the intention for updating this capability's name is to provide a place to capture FinOps' interaction with other processes and standards being used by your organization. the updated name clarifies this intention and allows for extending beyond ITAM to include ITFM, TBM, SAM, and Sustainability among others. ITAM plays an important role with FinOps and we will continue investing in the ITAM content here with future working-groups. see [this Capability's](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/asset-management/) Definition, Functional Activities, and Maturity Assessment sections for more details.
