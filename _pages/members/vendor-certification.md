If you are interested in creating your own FinOps training courses, FinOps Foundation has open sourced the [curriculum](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/curriculum) around which that exam has been created for the benefit of companies offering training.

If you donâ€™t want to build you own course from scratch, the instructor-led version of FinOps Practitioner Training is already available and can be re-sold by Authorized Training Partners (ATP). FinOps Practitioner Training is updated frequently and already maps directly to the FinOps Certified Practitioner exam.
