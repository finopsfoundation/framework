# FinOps Foundation Projects FAQ

## Working Groups

### What are Working Groups?
FinOps Foundation Working Groups (WGs) are small (6-8 member teams), cross-functional groups of people producing best practices for a specific FinOps capability or challenge. They operate in 6-8 week sprints and have their content published by the FinOps Foundation to contribute towards building the FinOps community, advancing FinOps practitioners in their practice, and establishing FinOps best practices and standards.

### What does the lifecycle of a WG look like?

Working groups proceed through a four-phase lifecycle. First, is idea **incubation** when a community member submits an idea for a working group. Next, is the **proposal** phase to further define the working group purpose and plan of action. Once approved, the working group is considered **active** while it runs through the planned sprints. Lastly, when their purpose is achieved working groups **graduate** and close. 

### Can ideas for WGs be submitted by anyone?
Yes! Any member of the F2 community can submit an idea for a WG.

### How are WG ideas submitted?
[The Projects Overview page at finops.org](https://www.finops.org/projects/overview/) displays a list of current Working Groups. If your idea is not already listed, then look for the "[Click here to submit an idea](https://forms.monday.com/forms/db4205de73d08ebbf7bd2151ce89a1a5?r=use1)" link near the top of the page.


### What happens after a WG idea is submitted?
Ideas will be reviewed by F2 staff for a decision on whether or not to proceed with developing a proposal for the working group. If needed, F2 staff will follow up with you for more information. Decisions on new WG ideas are typically completed within three weeks from the submission date. Note WG proposals are still subject to acceptance prior to starting WG sprints.

### What happens if my WG idea is selected?
If your idea is selected, then you will:
  * be notified of the decision.
  * be asked if you would like to lead or co-lead the WG (practitioner members only)
  * be invited to create the WG proposal and help find other community members to aid in this effort (which will eventually form the WG members)

### What is the structure of a WG?
A Working Group is made up of:

| Role | Description |
|---:|:---|
| F2 Community Practitioner Lead | at least 1 FinOps community member practitioner that leads the WG; up to a max of 3 community member practitioner leads. |
| F2 Community Contributors | F2 community members participating in the WG; community members can be a mix of practitioner-members, partner-members, vendor-members, and any TAC and GB members |
| F2 Staff Sponsor | at least 1 FinOps Foundation staff member sponsoring the WG |
| F2 TAC Liaison | at least 1 FinOps Foundation TAC member serving as the primary liaison for the WG |

### How are working group leads selected?
F2 community members who are practitioners are eligible to lead working groups. If eligible, the individual(s) who submitted the working group idea are asked if they are willing to lead the working group. Otherwise, F2 practitioner members can volunteer to be a WG Practitioner Lead, or a practitioner may be nominated to the role by (i) the TAC Liaison, F2 Staff Sponsor and/or (ii) the WG members. This role may be held by a max 3 members practitioner members.

### What does it mean to be a WG Practitioner Lead?
This role must be held and performed by an active F2 FinOps Practitioner member (up to a max of 3 members). The WG Practitioner Lead(s) organize and lead the WG aligned to the scope and sprint timeline in order to produce the artifacts/resources described by their WG Proposal. This role is expected to chair the WG meetings, set the meeting agenda, capture meeting minutes and track/follow-up on actions captured/resolved. F2 practitioner members can volunteer to be a WG Practitioner Lead, or a practitioner may be nominated to the role by (i) the TAC Liaison and/or (ii) the WG members.

### What does the WG proposal template look like?
The WG Proposal template is intended to be a relatively short abstract of your idea and the corresponding deliverables the WG is planning to produce for the F2 community. The current version of the template can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18N8ItF1JZsEO5a_Xf7czLA5THaxnpOV3JL8QVpez9EM/edit?usp=sharing).

### What is the criteria for deciding whether or not to accept a WG proposal? 
  * How the WG aligns to the [FinOps Foundation mission and objectives](https://www.finops.org/about/)
  * How the WG efforts and outputs will benefit the community
  * A logical high-level plan of how to achieve the WG purpose 

### What happens if my WG proposal is approved?
The fun part begins! The WG can start tackling the proposed topic and work towards creating a resource for the F2 community. Ideally, you’ll meet weekly to stay in sync as a team while working to complete tasks for the current sprint. Along the way, the WG will provide updates on progress to the TAC and the F2 community at Summits.

### What happens during a WG sprint?
During your WG sprint, contributors will…
  * Continue to meet as a team with the goal of collaborating to understand and conquer FinOps challenges 
  * Provide updates on progress to the F2 community at FinOps Summits and to the TAC
  * Produce deliverables for the benefit of the community

### Who can participate in working groups?
F2 community members can participate in working groups. To ensure quality participation, practitioner and vendor members are limited to participating in two simultaneous working groups. Consultant members are limited to participating in one working group at a time. Please reference [community access criteria](http://foundation/community-access-criteria.md%20at%20main%20%C2%B7%20finopsfoundation/foundation%20%C2%B7%20GitHub) for more information.

### How do I join a working group?
To join a working group fill out the [Working Group Interest - Join Request form](https://share.hsforms.com/1JE3npzyMTGWSFhBF6FAPYw38fku). When filling out this form it is important to submit the email address associated with your FinOps community membership as only FinOps community members are eligible to participate in working groups. For more information on working group participation see [community access criteria](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/foundation/blob/main/community-access-criteria.md).

Working groups only accept new members during the proposal pending phase or at the start of a new sprint. Requests to join a working group mid-sprint will be considered by the staff sponsor and working group lead. 

Not all working groups are open to the public. Exclusive working groups do not accept new joiners to the WG after the proposal pending phase. Exclusive working groups may be invite only or SME only. 

### How do I get added to working group meetings?
Completion of the [Working Group Interest - Join Request form](https://share.hsforms.com/1JE3npzyMTGWSFhBF6FAPYw38fku) will kick off our internal processes to add you to the working group meetings and the dedicated WG Slack channel if you are not already on each. 

### What happens after the WG sprint ends?
At the end of each sprint working groups will take a 1-2 week break before proceeding on to the next sprint. When a WG has completed all approved  sprints they will consider if additional sprints are necessary. If yes, the WG goes back to revise the proposal and re-submits for acceptance. If additional sprints are not necessary you may pat yourself on the back for a job well done!
When all sprints are complete F2 staff will ensure:
* the dedicated WG folder of GDrive is moved into the Graduated WG Projects folder
* the Slack channel is archived or renamed to a chat channel
* the WG meeting series is removed from calendars

## Special Interest Groups

### What are Special Interest Groups?
FinOps Foundation Special Interest Groups (SIGs) represent supplementary communities within the FinOps Foundation that are organized around industry, regions, or other topics of interest related to FinOps. SIGs provide opportunities for practioner connection, exploration of topics, and share knowledge between those involved. SIGs can host meet-ups to encourage members to come together. SIGs can also form their own WGs to create content for their area of interest or regionally adapt FinOps Foundation content their needs (for example: creating non-english content translations).


### What is the structure of a SIG?
An Special Interest Group is made up of:

| Role | Description |
|---:|---|
| SIG Owner(s) | at least 1 FinOps Foundation Practitioner member that owns or is working on the corresponding initiatives represented by the SIG; up to a max of 3 community member practitioner leads |
| TAC Contributor(s) | FinOps Foundation TAC non-voting member serving as the primary liaison for the SIG; attends SIG meetings as needed/requested; advises SIG WGs to drive action and engaging internally with community members as a FinOps SME |
| F2 Community | members of the FinOps Foundation community participating on SIG projects; help define SIG roadmap; form WGs and produce deliverables for the SIG |


### What does it mean to be a SIG Owner?
A SIG Owner is recognized as an expert in the area of interest the SIG is being organized to explore, and for their ability to lead (or co-lead) the SIG to produce a SIG roadmap and the corresponding unbiased outputs. Each SIG can have 1-3 SIG Owners that are responsible for leading the SIG, collecting and compiling topics for their meeting agenda, chairing the meeting, ensuring that quality meeting minutes are published, and follow-up actions tracked and resolved. Additionally, SIG Owners are expected to actively encourage a diverse range of community members to participate as diversity is strongly encouraged within SIGs. A SIG Owner tenure last for 6 months but can be extended.


### Do SIGs attend the F2 TAC meeting?
Yes. A SIG Owner (or designate) is expected to attend the TAC meeting and provide updates on their activities, road map, and resourcing needs.


### When should a SIG be created?
SIGs should only be created in combination with high-demand interest from the community about the intersection of FinOps and another area (like Public Sector, Industry, Policy, etc). A Conversation Space (aka a slack channel) is a great first step to gauge community engagement before creating a SIG.


### What is a Conversation Space?
A Conversation Space is a great first step to gauge community engagement before creating a SIG.  SIGs should only be created only in combination with high-demand interest from the community about the intersection of FinOps and another area (Public Sector, Industry, Policy, etc.).


### How long can a SIG remain active?
As long as the SIG maintains an updated roadmap, is actively working on initiatives, has community engagement, provides updates to the TAC, and is following F2 policy/guidelines then the SIG can remain active indefinitely.

### Can SIGs produce content for finops.org ?
Yes. A SIG can bring forward any resources or deliverables they would like to have considered for publishing to the TAC meeting. The SIG Owner will work with the F2 Objective Group core team towards having the resource approved for publishing to finops.org.

### What happens when a SIG is not-active?
A SIG and it's associated initiatives will be suspended including archiving of any corresponding Slack channel archived when...
* the SIG has not provided an update to the TAC for 6 months
* there is little to no activity in the SIG Slack channel
* SIG monthly meetings are not/inconsistently occurring
* there are no active WGs in the SIG

If at a later date there is renewed support to reinstate a suspected SIG, the previous initiatives will need to be reviewed/adopted by the newly restarted SIG team.
