# FinOps Foundation Projects FAQ

### Working Groups

#### What are Working Groups?
FinOps Foundation Working Groups (WGs) are small (think two-pizza team), cross-functional groups of people producing best practices for a specific FinOps capability or challenge.  They operate in 6-8 week sprints and have their content published by the FinOps Foundation to contribute towards building the FinOps community, advancing FinOps practitioners in their practice and establishing FinOps best practices and standards.


#### Can ideas for WGs be submitted by anyone?
Yes!  Any member of the F2 community can submit an idea for a WG.   Ideas will be reviewed and the F2 staff may follow-up with you for more information and to discuss your idea.  


#### How are WG ideas submitted?
[The Projects Overview page at finops.org](https://www.finops.org/projects/overview/) displays a list of current Working Groups. If your idea is not already listed, then look for the "[Click here to submit an idea](https://forms.monday.com/forms/db4205de73d08ebbf7bd2151ce89a1a5?r=use1)" link near the top of the page.


#### What happens after a WG idea is submitted?
Ideas will be reviewed and the F2 staff may follow-up with you for more information and to discuss your idea.


#### What happens if my WG idea is selected?
If your idea is selected, then you will…
1. be provided a WG Proposal template to fill-out
1. be invited to introduce your idea to the F2 community at the next FinOps Monthly summit; this is a great way to gather support and find contributors to help with the proposal (which will also eventually form the WG members)
1. review the proposal with the F2 Objective Group core team for alignment with [the FinOps Foundation's mission](https://www.finops.org/about/) and consideration for approval.


#### What happens if my WG proposal is approved?
The fun part begins!  As a WG, you all can gather, kick-off and start tackling the WG topic proposed to create a resource for the F2 community.  Ideally, you'll setup a weekly meeting cadence to stay in sync as a team while working on your deliverable for the current sprint.



#### What happens during my WG sprint?
During your WG sprint, you will..
1. continue to meet as a team with the goal of producing a resource for the F2 community on the proposed topic being pursued
1. provide updates on progress to the F2 community at FinOps Summits
1. provide updates to the F2 Objective Group core team responsible for your WG


#### What happens after the WG sprint ends?
Once your WG sprint wraps, you will…
1. provide your deliverable to the TAC for review and approval
1. present your deliverable to the F2 community at an upcoming FinOps Summit (assuming TAC approval)
1. provide your deliverable to the F2 staff to be published on finops.org as a resource from which FinOps practitioners and the broader community can learn and benefit


#### What happens if my WG idea is BIG (yuuge!) and 1 sprint is not enough?
No problem!  If the project you're planning to tackle requires multiple sprints, then plan to break it down so that each subsequent WG sprint…
1. has a WG proposal doc describing the scope and deliverable for the next sprint
1. produces a deliverable
1. follows the same review/approval process as the original sprint

Ultimately the goal is to ensure WGs are setup for success; each sprint should be independent (as possible),  produce a helpful deliverable for the F2 community, and avoid scope creep/neverending meetings #gak!


#### What is the structure of a WG?
A Working Group is made up of:

| Role | Description |
|---:|:---|
| F2 Community Practitioner Lead | at least 1 FinOps community member practitioner that leads the WG; up to a max of 3 community member practitioner leads. |
| F2 Community Contributors | F2 community members participating in the WG; community members can be a mix of practitioner-members, partner-members, vendor-members, and any TAC and GB members |
| F2 Staff Liaison | at least 1 FinOps Foundation staff member liaison for the WG |
| F2 TAC Liaison | at least 1 FinOps Foundation TAC member serving as the primary liaison for the WG |


#### What does it mean to be a WG Practitioner Lead?
This role must be held and performed by an active F2 FinOps Practitioner member (up to a max of 3 members).  The WG Practitioner Lead(s) organize and lead the WG aligned to the scope and sprint timeline in order to produce the artifacts/resources described by their WG Proposal. This role is expected to chair the WG meetings, set the meeting agenda, capture meeting minutes and track/follow-up on actions captured/resolved.  F2 practitioner members can volunteer to be a WG Practitioner Lead, or a practitioner may be nominated to the role by (i) the TAC Liaison and/or (ii) the WG members.


#### What does the  WG proposal template look like?
The WG Proposal template is intended to be a relatively short abstract of your idea and the corresponding deliverable the WG is hoping to produce for the F2 community.  It consists of 8 sections.  [The current version of the template can be viewed here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gbm9y-iqCKnnXjakRYo-LNA-lcmly6l9s-eYfBRHxns/edit?usp=sharing).

### Special Interest Groups

#### What are Special Interest Groups?
FinOps Foundation Special Interest Groups (SIGs) represent supplementary communities within the FinOps Foundation that are organized around industry, regions, or other topics of interest related to FinOps. SIGs provide opportunities for practioner connection, exploration of topics, and share knowledge between those involved.  SIGs can host meet-ups to encourage members to come together.  SIGs can also form their own WGs to create content for their area of interest or regionally adapt FinOps Foundation content their needs (for example: creating non-english content translations).


#### What is the structure of a SIG?
An Special Interest Group is made up of:

| Role | Description |
|---:|---|
| SIG Owner(s) | at least 1 FinOps Foundation Practitioner member that owns or is working on the corresponding initiatives represented by the SIG; up to a max of 3 community member practitioner leads |
| TAC Contributor(s) | FinOps Foundation TAC non-voting member serving as the primary liaison for the SIG; attends SIG meetings as needed/requested; advises SIG WGs to drive action and engaging internally with community members as a FinOps SME |
| F2 Community | members of the FinOps Foundation community participating on SIG projects; help define SIG roadmap; form WGs and produce deliverables for the SIG |


#### What does it mean to be a SIG Owner?
A SIG Owner is recognized as an expert in the area of interest the SIG is being organized to explore, and for their ability to lead (or co-lead) the SIG to produce a SIG roadmap and the corresponding unbiased outputs. Each SIG can have 1-3 SIG Owners that are responsible for leading the SIG,  collecting and compiling topics for their meeting agenda, chairing the meeting, ensuring that quality meeting minutes are published, and follow-up actions tracked and resolved. Additionally, SIG Owners are expected to actively encourage a diverse range of community members to participate as diversity is strongly encouraged within SIGs.  A SIG Owner tenure last for 6 months but can be extended.


#### Do SIGs attend the F2 TAC meeting?
Yes.  A SIG Owner (or designate) is expected to attend the TAC meeting and provide updates on their activities, road map, and  resourcing needs


#### When should a SIG be created?
SIGs should only be created in combination with high-demand interest from the community about the intersection of FinOps and another area (like Public Sector, Industry, Policy, etc).  A Conversation Space (aka a slack channel) is a great first step to gauge community engagement before creating a SIG.


#### What is a Conversation Space?
A Conversation Space is a great first step to gauge community engagement before creating a SIG.  SIGs should only be created only in combination with high-demand interest from the community about the intersection of FinOps and another area (Public Sector, Industry, Policy, etc).


#### How long can a SIG remain active?
As long as the SIG maintains an updated roadmap, is actively working on initiatives, has community engagement, provides updates to the TAC, and is following F2 policy/guidelines then the SIG can remain active indefinitely.



#### Can SIGs produce content for finops.org ?
Yes.  A SIG can bring forward any resources or deliverables they would like to have considered for publishing to the TAC meeting.  the SIG Owner will work with the F2 Objective Group  core team towards having the resource approved for publishing to finops.org


#### What happens when a SIG is not-active?
A SIG and it's associated initiatives will be suspended including archiving of any corresponding Slack channel archived when...
* the SIG has not provided an update to the TAC for 6 months
* there is little to no activity in the SIG Slack channel
* SIG monthly meetings are not/inconsistently occurring
* there are no active WGs in the SIG

If at a later date there is renewed support to reinstate a suspected SIG, the previous initiatives will need to be reviewed/adopted by the newly restarted SIG team.
