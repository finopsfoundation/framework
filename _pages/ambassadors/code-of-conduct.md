# FinOps Foundation Ambassador Code of Conduct

As contributors in the FinOps Foundation community, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who attend, participate and contribute to FinOps Foundation events and materials.

We are committed to making participation in the FinOps Foundation community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies both within working spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the FinOps Foundation and its community.

## FinOps Foundation Events
FinOps Foundation events, or events run by the Linux Foundation with professional events staff, are governed by the Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct. In addition to being inclusive as well as treating others with respect and kindness we specifically ask that there are no sales pitches or promotion of services.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
* The selling or promotion of services provided by your employer
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

FinOps Foundation staff and FinOps Ambassadors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, FinOps Foundation staff and FinOps Ambassadors commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing the community. Anyone who does not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the FinOps Foundation community.

## Reporting
For incidents occurring in the FinOps Foundation community, contact the FinOps Foundation via Conduct@FinOps.org. You can expect a response within three business days.

## Enforcement
The FinOps Foundation Governing Board enforces code of conduct issues. They try to resolve incidents without punishment, but may remove people from the project or FinOps Foundation communities at their discretion.
