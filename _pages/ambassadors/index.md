## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How often are ambassador applications reviewed?

We review applications monthly, but can only accept a few new FOA Ambassadors from the pool of highly-qualified individuals at a time.  We do this in order to make sure we grow this program responsibly and provide the right local communities with the appropriate level of support. We will do our best to provide feedback on every application we receive within a month of submission.

### Do I need to re-apply?

No, once you formally apply you are part of the pool of applicants that get reviewed on a monthly basis.

### Will you email me with a status update of my application each month?

No. After we send you our initial feedback, we will only follow up if your application is accepted.

### I am a consultant or vendor and active in the FinOps community. Why can’t I be an ambassador?

Unfortunately, there is too much potential for conflict of interest and code of conduct violations due to the nature of your jobs. You are absolutely welcome to continue contributing and supporting local meetup groups. In fact, we find that local ambassadors that team with a consultant/vendor have even greater success than by organizing meetups on their own.  

However, in order to remove the potential commercial conflicts of interest, we cannot grant consultants and vendors the official role of Ambassador.  FinOps Ambassadors speak on behalf of the FinOps Foundation. As we are cloud, consultant and vendor agnostic, we cannot have vendors or consultants representing us in an official capacity without there being a conflict of interest.

### I work for a vendor but I am in a practitioner role. Can I be a FinOps Ambassador?

Yes! If you are doing the role of FinOps practitioner for the company that you work for, you are a practitioner. If you are selling FinOps services and engagements or you are developing services and tooling to sell to FinOps practitioners, then you are considered a Consultant or Vendor and cannot hold the title of FinOps Ambassador.  


### What if I want to step down or don't have the time to commit anymore?

We have an Emeritus status to address Ambassadors who'd like to step down from active engagement temporarily or indefinitely but still be invited to participate in calls and the community. If you decide to become more active again, emeritus ambassadors are always welcome to be reinstated as full FOA Ambassadors. Please reach out to Joe in order to start this process.
