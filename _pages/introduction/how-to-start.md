# How to start 

How do you determine when and how much to invest in it?

If you’re in cloud and trying to allocate costs and are worried about overspending then you’re doing FinOps.

- Cloud spend is material
- Existing procurement processes fall over 
- Engineers now hold the keys to spending
- Economic instability has accelerated cloud adoption while increasing focus on margins/savings

This document starts with an assumption that you are convinced FinOps is needed, let’s talk about how and when to set it up in your organization. 

## When to FinOps? (Self-Assessment)

What is your tipping point? 

Dimensions to consider:
- Org complexity and time required to setup the practice
- Avoiding NIMBYism through accountability
- FinOps Co-Efficient, how many $$ of waste matters to us? Is it $2m/yr, $10m, $50m?
- Cloud spend total in relation to total IT spend (FinOps vs TBM graph)
- Iron Triangle focus: e.g. engineering deliverables vs cost optimization importance
- Level of distributed teams
- Complexity of the org tree: centralized IT vs distributed
- Agile and DevOps dimension: consumption and use of cloud in orgs
- Models of cloud: profile of cloud adoption: cloud first vs native vs hybrid
- Number of people involved with cloud deployment

## How to build the business case?
- How to get to doing it
- Arming the evangelists with MVF, Co-Efficient, Risks, etc
- And how to convince the CIO (you need to invest in this practice or get f'ed)
- Cost to the business and the opportunity to increase velocity
- Examples of companies like you who did or did not do it
- And the engineers & product team (this is now part of your job and how it won’t slow you down)
- And the finance and procurement (current processes won't work and you need to optimize costs)
- When and how to show saving potential for shock/awe (theoretical vs actual)
- How to get management buy-in: not just DevOps but a cultural collaboration
- Selling the vision for what it can do vs what we expect to do in near vs long term
