<!-- ### Curriculum
If you are interested in creating your own FinOps training courses, FinOps Foundation has open sourced the [curriculum](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/curriculum) around which that exam has been created for the benefit of companies offering training.

If you donâ€™t want to build you own course from scratch, the instructor-led version of FinOps Practitioner Training is already available and can be re-sold by Authorized Training Partners (ATP). FinOps Practitioner Training is updated frequently and already maps directly to the FinOps Certified Practitioner exam.

If you are interested in becoming an exam reseller, we also offer wholesale pricing on our exams to training companies purchasing in bulk. -->
