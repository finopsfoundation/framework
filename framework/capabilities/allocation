There are three core methods for adding cost allocation data to usage and billing data:
 
Resource-level tag
Applied by engineers or the cloud platform provider directly to the cloud resources.

Accounts/projects/subscriptions
Provided by the vendor and represented in the bill.

Post bill data constructs
Uncovered by mutating the billing data and supplementing in extra detail using a third-party analytics tool like Apptio Cloudability or self-managed data processing.
