# Software Asset Management

## Introduction
Introduce the framework function within one to two paragraphs. There are more sections below to go into greater detail.

Be brief and concise, assume there will be a minimal level of knowledge of the subject area by the reader. There will also be more detailed documentation such as whitepapers on the topic for depth, so focus on the most impactful points.
 
The goal here is to ease them into the topic and get them in the right mindset. Things you need to cover:
- Define the function topic: in 1 sentence explain what it is you are managing/implementing. Consider the following format: Automation replaces repetitive tasks with code.
- Explain what it does and why its required: add the benefit to the previous sentence. Consider the following format: Automation replaces repetitive tasks with code, this removes operational overhead reducing your costs and allows you to scale faster.
- Define the main areas of the topic: (if required) list the main areas in order that they need to be considered/implemented, they will be defined/explained later. Consider: Automation has 3 parts: identify , deployment, maintenance reviews.

## Sample Implementation
Give an example of how the function is implemented in a FinOps practice. Feel free to use images, figures, charts, and/or graphs to explain it.

Place a simple diagram of what a sample implementation or cycle would look like, it should have no more than 12 components in it.

## Common Approaches
List common approaches for using this function within a FinOps practice.

## Maturity Examples
Explain how this function may differ depending on the maturity level of the FinOps practice.

In each phase (crawl, walk, run) identify one incorrect practice that people are doing at this stage, to help them identify where they are at. If there are many, simply state the most common, easiest & most impactful one that will be identified by most organizations. Just state the incorrect practice, do not address why its bad or the impact. There will always be 1 incorrect practice at the crawl, there may not be incorrect practices at walk/run.
State the incorrect practice in a positive way - do not state the opposite of the best practice. Consider: Users are doing repetitve tasks manually. Do not use: Users are *not doing* things programatically.
 
Then state what customers should be doing at this stage to rectify the issue. If there are multilpe things to do - group them into a higher level concept, or state the most common and simple things. Each activity must result in a change or have something implemented, and be completed in the stage. Tasks like *Planning*, *considering*, or *producing* will not result in a change and should not be used. Partially completing an activity or completing an activity on a small scale such as *automate simple tasks* or *automate some tasks* followed by *automate all tasks* should not be used.
keep it simple, 1 or 2 sentences for each, focus on the outcomes or what is delivered, do not specify the busy tasks required to produce the output.

* **Crawl:**
* **Walk:**
* **Run:**

## Common KPIs
List and explain common KPIs that help track the effectiveness of the function. Alternatively, list favorable outcomes that represent success if specific KPIs aren’t clear enough.

## Cautionary Tales
Explain to users what to look out for or any pitfalls to avoid when building and implementing the function into their FinOps practice.

When looking at what they should do above, they can do the right things in the wrong way, or rely too much on one & not the other. Here you further guide them to ensure they're getting the right outcomes, by adding some more definition or calling out a way that a good thing can result in a bad result.
