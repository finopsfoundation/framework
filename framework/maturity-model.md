# FinOps Maturity Model

The practice of FinOps is inherently iterative and maturity of any given process, functional activity, [Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/) or [Domain](https://www.finops.org/framework/domains/) will improve with repetition.

A “Crawl, Walk, Run” approach to performing FinOps enables organizations to start small, and grow in scale, scope and complexity as business value warrants maturing a functional activity. Taking quick action at a small scale and limited scope allows FinOps teams to assess the outcomes of their actions, and to gain insights into the value of taking further action in a larger, faster, or more granular way.

In assessing the state of an organization’s FinOps [Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/) or [Domain](https://www.finops.org/framework/domains/), we can also use these maturity designations to identify where we are currently operating, and to identify areas we’d like to move from a Crawl to a Walk, or from a Walk to a Run maturity.

These terms are general guidelines, and an organization’s goal should never be simply to achieve a “Run” maturity in every [Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/).

As [the FinOps Principles](https://www.finops.org/framework/principles/) tell us, business value should drive our decision making.  An organization that has established "Walk" stage anomaly detection - which has proven adequate in detecting the few cost spikes the organization has previously experienced - should consider investing time evolving other [FinOps Capabilities](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/) which could provide an immediate benefit. Effort spent maturing a Capability that is meeting the measurement of success could move an organization's maturity in that individual capability from Crawl to Walk, or Walk to Run - but provide no benefit to the measurement of success.

In other words, establishing a Walk stage in a particular Capability is not necessarily a good or bad thing, FinOps practitioners should focus less on maturing each Capability to "Run" for everything and more on achieving the outcomes [the FinOps Capabilities](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/) aim to provide.

Prioritize maturing the Capabilities that provide your organization the highest business value.

Every Capability and functional activity can be at a different level of maturity. But using this sort of rubric to indicate where we think we are operating allows a convenient shorthand to communicate effectively.

#### FinOps Maturity Model Guidelines

| FinOps Maturity Level | Maturity Level Characteristics | Sample goals/KPI from [the FinOps Community](https://data.finops.org) <br/>[*(data.finops.org)*](https://data.finops.org) |
| --: | --- | --- |
| **Crawl** |  very little reporting and tooling <br/><br/> measurements only provide insight into the benefits of maturing the capability <br/><br/> basic KPIs set for the measurement of success <br/><br/> basic processes and policies are defined around the capability <br/><br/> Capability is understood but not followed by all the major teams within the organization <br/><br/> plans to address "low hanging fruit" | should be able to allocate at least 50% <br/><br/> resource-based commitments discount target coverage of approximately 60% <br/><br/> forecast spend to actual spend accuracy variance is 20% |
| **Walk** | Capability is understood and followed within the organization <br/><br/> difficult edge cases are identified but decision to not address them is adopted <br/><br/> automation and/or processes cover most of the Capability requirements <br/><br/> most difficult edge cases are identified and effort to resolve has been estimated <br/><br/> medium to high goals/KPIs set on the measurement of success | should be able to allocate at least 80% <br/><br/> resource-based commitments discount target coverage is approximately 70% <br/><br/> forecast spend to actual spend accuracy variance is 15% |
| **Run** | Capability is understood and followed by all teams within the organization <br/><br/> Difficult edge cases are being addressed <br/><br/> very high goals/KPIs set on the measurement of success <br/><br/> Automation is the preferred approach | greater than 90% of spend can be allocated <br/><br/> resource-based commitments discount target coverage is approximately 80% <br/><br/> forecast spend to actual spend accuracy variance is 12% |
