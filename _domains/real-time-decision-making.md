# Real-Time Decision Making

When we understand what we are spending, and understand how we are performing relative to expectations and standards, we can then use that information to make real-time decisions as we receive new information.

The goal here is not to specifically strive for real-time data in and of itself, but to leverage timely access to consistent cost & usage data for making continuous adjustments.  

This Domain improves stakeholder enablement by curating data in stakeholder-specific contexts,  iteratively improving decision velocity and aligning organizational processes to the realities of operating in the cloud.  Over time we strive to push this decision making further into the organization's edges, enabling activities for the subsequent Domains.

At its core, this Domain answers the question: What actions can I take now to allow me to better meet my organizational goals and objectives?
