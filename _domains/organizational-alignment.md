# Organizational Alignment

Within this domain, the organization acts and automates to manage cloud use within the context of other IT Finance activities, and integrates FinOps capabilities with existing organizational processes, organizational units, and technology.

This Domain contains the capabilities weâ€™ll use to continuously improve, to change and align our organization itself - its people, processes and technology - to use cloud in the way it will benefit the company best. Actions here may be to improve  persona centric enablement, FinOps training and adoption, and to align existing processes to support cloud use more effectively.

At its core, this Domain answers the question: What changes can I make within my organization to use cloud more effectively?
