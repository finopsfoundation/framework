# Cloud Usage Optimization

Within this domain, the organization identifies and takes action to match running cloud resources to the actual demand of the workloads running at any given time. This work involves predictive rightsizing of resources, managing workloads to align with the correct number of scaling resources, turning resources off when not in use, and other techniques.

The Usage Optimization domain contains the set of capabilities to match our actual workload needs to the cloud services we use at any given time as closely as possible. Using the right resources, in the right size, only when we need them to produce business value is ultimately what the variable use model of cloud allows us to do to maximize value to our business.

At its core, this Domain answers the question: How can we change what we’re using and when we’re using it in the cloud to better meet our organizational goals?
