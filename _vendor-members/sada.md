  As a leading global provider of business and technology services, SADA empowers people to transform their work, their organizations and the world. SADA teams have helped enterprise clients in healthcare, media & entertainment, retail, manufacturing and the public sector achieve their boldest ambitions and solve their most complex problems. A Google Cloud Partner with multiple Specializations and premier MSP, SADA delivers continuous innovation, strong partnerships and service excellence.

  SADA understands companies need a combination of software and services managed by experienced FinOps practitioners who can guide them through the process of optimizing and tracking their cloud use and spend.

  With a dedicated FinOps team, SADA offers two types of engagements: 1) Targeted engagements focused on building clients’ skills in the realms of operating efficiency and visibility/reporting. These engagements are tailored toward clients with an established FinOps practice with a need to expand existing capabilities. 2) For clients with no FinOps practice at all, SADA will offer multi-month, highly immersive services designed to help you assemble and enable a FinOps team entirely from the ground up. Our experts will both triage current challenges around your cloud spend and assist in creating or expanding your FinOps organization internally, fully enabling you to maintain best practices after the triage phase is completed.
