  The DoiT Cloud Management Platform (CMP) is an ML-powered, intelligent platform that enables FinOps-minded companies to:

  2) Find opportunities to optimize their multi-cloud spend and directly save operating costs  

  3) Define the rules by which their cloud environment should operate, proactively alert them when things inevitably change, and take corrective action appropriately  

  4) Automatically detect operating anomalies that clients may not be looking for  

  5) Create and manage temporary cloud environments that are securely governed  

  6) Maintain a direct line of support and services communication to our global team of Cloud Ops and FinOps experts at DoiT
