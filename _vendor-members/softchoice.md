  Modular services to simplify and streamline operating in the cloud

  To compete today, many organizations have made the cloud a vital part of their strategy. Yet realizing the actual value of cloud services and infrastructure can be difficult. Limited IT resources, lack of standards, cloud misconfigurations and the struggle to manage costs are common barriers to reaping the full benefits of the cloud. Softchoice Cloud Management Services are modular, simple to consume and easy to combine as needed. As you progress through cloud transformation, modules can be integrated along your journey.

  • Simplify cloud operational management: get visibility into computing, network and storage resources within a single pane of glass. Automate discovery for all cloud resources with actionable data that helps you improve cost, efficiency and security.

  • Standardize, automate and orchestrate across clouds: orchestrate infrastructure and automate operations across several clouds with a powerful orchestration engine. Standardize architectures within corporate guidelines for versions, patches and configuration.

  • 24/7/365 cloud monitoring and management: monitor applications, cloud infrastructure and databases for performance and availability, OS patching and security events.

  • Control and optimize cloud costs: gain insight into cloud spend with drill-down capability on any metric, including visibility into individual cloud resources. Show charge-back costs by project or department. Participate in ongoing sessions that provide recommendations and best practices around cloud discounts, reserved instances, RDS, cheaper regions, low account or service usage.

  • Receive ongoing cloud mentorship: receive ongoing mentorship covering cloud configuration, automation and orchestration through scheduled workshop sessions with certified cloud architects for guidance on cloud planning and deployments across public, private and hybrid clouds.

  • Rely on 24/7/365 live cloud technical support: work with a single point of contact and dedicated engineers for service reporting, incident and escalation management based on ITIL service management.
