## Definition

Workload Management & Automation focuses on running resources only when they are needed, and creating the mechanisms to automatically adjust what resources are running at any given time.  This Capability is intended to give FinOps teams the ability to match supply to demand most efficiently, and effectively optimize cloud usage through measurement of workload demand and provisioning capacity dynamically.




## Maturity Assessment
_description of the characteristics of each maturity level (crawl, walk, run) for this Capability in the context of the organization's FinOps practice._



## Functional Activity
_written for each persona responsible for the functional activity and processes encapsulated by his Capability.  each one should be associated generally to one of the FinOps Phases (Inform, Optimize, Operate). for example:_
>As a [FinOps Persona], I will [functional activity] so that [desired outcome] is achieved.



## Measure(s) of Success
_at least one measure of success; should be described in a context of cost; this could be an efficiency KPI or an agreed upon threshold or target._
_for example:_
>* idle resource costs will not exceed 3% of total monthly cloud spend
* anomaly costs will not exceed $150/month



## Inputs
_the information used that contributes to the measure(s) of success listed above; information here may include specific datasources, reports or any relevant input_


<!-- ####### Real World Resources ####### -->
## Real World Resources
_a collection of real world examples, stories and “how to” for this Capability; based on FinOps community member experiences; information here may:_
>* _apply to one or more cloud providers_
* _include specific types of cloud services used) (compute, storage, database, etc...)_
* _describe a combination of  tooling, platform or vendor_
* _describe the industry the organization belongs to_
* _describe the complexity of the organization (global, enterprise, etc…)_
* _include the FinOps personas involved and any other organizational roles_
