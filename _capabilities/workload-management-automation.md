# Workload Management & Automation

## Domains
<!-- _x-ref to the FinOps Domain(s) to which this Capability corresponds_ -->
{% include domains-loop.md %}


## Definition

Workload Management & Automation focuses on running resources only when they are needed, and creating the mechanisms to automatically adjust what resources are running at any given time.  This Capability is intended to give FinOps teams the ability to match supply to demand most efficiently, and effectively optimize cloud usage through measurement of workload demand and provisioning capacity dynamically.

## Maturity Assessment
_description of the characteristics of each maturity level (crawl, walk, run) for this Capability in the context of the organization's FinOps practice._


## Functional Activity
_written for each persona responsible for the functional activity and processes encapsulated by his Capability.  each one should be associated generally to one of the FinOps Phases (Inform, Optimize, Operate). for example:_
>As a [FinOps Persona], I will [functional activity] so that [desired outcome] is achieved.


## Measure(s) of Success & KPI
Measures of success are represented in the context of cloud costs and may include one or more key performance indicators ( KPI ), describe objectives with key results ( OKR ), and declare thresholds defining outliers or acceptable variance from forecasted trends.

_at least one measure of success; should be described in a context of cost; this could be an efficiency KPI or an agreed upon threshold or target._
_for example:_
>* idle resource costs will not exceed 3% of total monthly cloud spend
* anomaly costs will not exceed $150/month



## Inputs
_the information used that contributes to the measure(s) of success listed above; information here may include specific datasources, reports or any relevant input_
