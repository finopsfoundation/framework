# Onboarding Workloads


{% include contribute-capabiility.md %}

{% include domains-loop.md %}


## Definition
This capability is about establishing a cloud front door process to onboard brownfield and greenfield applications through financial viability and technical feasibility assessment criteria.


## Maturity Assessment
#### Crawl
- Ad-hoc on-demand budgeting/requisition to onboard workloads to the cloud

#### Walk
- Budgeting process mandatory but not standardized across the Business Units / Product Teams. It considers all IT requested changes


#### Run
- Well-defined process and guidelines including both financial viability and technical feasibility for preparation of deploying new projects/applications or migrating existing workloads to the cloud



## Functional Activity
#### As someone in a Business/Product role, I will…
- Optimize my product with new cloud capabilities to drive efficiency and agility
- Develop new use cases to further innovate on the cloud


#### As someone in a Finance/FinOps role, I will…
- Assess the financial viability of the workloads moving to the cloud
- Capture and track cloud value benefits realization


#### As someone in an Engineering/Operations role, I will...
- Assess the cloud suitability of the workloads moving to the cloud
- Review the operational readiness to support the workloads on the cloud


#### As someone in an Executive role, I will…
- Make informed decisions to prioritize workloads to move to the cloud
- Provide strategic directions to reinvest the savings obtained from the workloads migrated to the cloud back to the business initiatives




## Measure(s) of Success
- Measurement of cost efficiency through infrastructure savings, migration and support costs
- Operational resiliency improvement in service quality and security risk posture
- Increase time to market by accelerating fluidity in product and service delivery
- Enable a culture of rapid experimentation to drive innovation and cloud transformation
- Embed true environmental and social sustainability across the organization




## Inputs
Information used that contributes to the measure(s) of success listed above are organized across the following categories:

| Category | Input |
|---:|---|
| **Cost Efficiency** | - Infrastructure cost<br>- Support cost<br>- Migration / implementation cost |
