# Establishing FinOps Culture

{% include contribute-capabiility.md %}

{% include domains-loop.md %}


## Definition
The word "_Kuleana_" is Hawaiian for "Responsibility".  Kuleana encourages us to be accountable for all that we do and is the "ability to respond" to whatever is happening.

With this in mind, this capability is about creating a movement to establish cultures of accountability so that your organization understands the practice of cloud cost management is really about leveraging FinOps to accelerate the creation of business value.

An organization's FinOps culture embraces a long term roadmap of transformation and continuous improvement across all [the FinOps Domains](https://www.finops.org/framework/domains/) at each stage of [FinOps Maturity](https://www.finops.org/framework/maturity-model/).  

It requires finding allies in the face of opposition, winning over detractors during times of change, defining a common language, creating metrics to prove value, building enablement strategies to elevate stakeholder teams, and developing communication programs to inspire [the FinOps Personas](https://www.finops.org/framework/personas/) in your organization.

At its core, FinOps is a cultural movement because the practice of Finops is more than a technology solution or a checklist you hand to your teams. It’s a living, breathing way of approaching the cloud and cloud financial management made possible by the collaboration of finance, engineering and executive leadership through the FinOps Framework.




## Maturity Assessment
#### Crawl
* Engineers are not familiar with what FinOps is and their role within it.
* FinOps metrics are available to teams but there is no set ritual followed by engineers around the metrics.
* Leadership is sold on the idea of FinOps but is not yet providing the buyin required.
* Finance and engineers are only just starting to meet.

#### Walk
* Engineers actively engage the FinOps processes, they understand the importance of FinOps within the business.
* FinOps metrics are “just another operational metric” teams monitor and optimise this metric.
* Leadership is actively supporting FinOps in the organisation. They make decisions on the Iron Triangle by insisting on knowing the cost impact and business value of the decision.
* Engineering and Finance are aware of each other and understand what motivators drive each other.
* Leadership celebrate FinOps success and celebrate/reward teams who have wins.

#### Run
* Engineers consider financial impact during each life-cycle.
* Engineers are actively looking for FinOps opportunities, reversing the flow of questions from finance to engineers more to engineers towards finance. Engineers proactively confirm budget and highlight changes that will impact costs.
* FinOps team advocates with Engineering teams for investment for solid financial endeavors.
- Business/Product Owners understand that their design decisions drive cost.
