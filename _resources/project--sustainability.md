# Digital Sustainability and Its Intersection with FinOps

*FinOps and GreenOps mutually support each other through a similar approach to conscientious and responsibility technology usage that enables workload efficiency and sustainability. If you are doing one of these - you are amplifying the other.*

## Abstract

The Sustainability Working Group (WG) builds knowledge and understanding to bring clarity to FinOps practitioners around the subject of digital sustainability and running applications in the cloud with zero carbon emission. 

**Our objective:** Help practitioners understand how they can positively contribute to their organizations drive to reduce digital carbon footprint and accelerate their path to net-zero.

The output of this working group will be delivered through a series of focused 4-8 week sprints undertaken by group members with input from subject matter experts (SMEs) both inside and outside the foundation. This WG Project will enable FinOps practitioners to understand the environmental impact of Cloud resource usage decisions and to make better informed decisions around the tradeoffs. It will allow practitioners to advocate for sustainability using specific processes, tools and frameworks.

## Sprint 0 and Sprint 1 Deliverables (August 2022 Summit Update)
A big focus of our working group is to deliver usable outputs for foundation members so that we can immediately make a positive impact.

[**Sprint 0** delivered an initial “baseline”](#scope), with a core objective of defining the group structure, vision and direction and to establish a way of working productively with a core team of part-time contributors from across the foundation. [**Sprint 1** delivered a full list of terms](#terms) that relate to Sustainability and GreenOps and how they affect FinOps personas.

**Sprint 0 deliverables include:**

* A clear, agreed and communicated vision for sustainability and FinOps
* Clearly demonstrate the link between FinOps and GreenOps
* Provide a list of known GreenOps remediation examples
* Create a high level framework detailing remaining objectives and deliverables

**Sprint 1 deliverables include:**

* Sustainability and GreenOps-related terms and definitions, and how they affect FinOps personas (practitioners and business leaders alike)
* A common ground for FinOps Foundation members to learn and redefine definitions as we all learn more about the intersection of FinOps and Sustainability

### Remaining Sprints (TBD on delivery dates)

* **Sprint 2:** Define how to measure Sustainability/FinOps progress by Maturity Level (e.g. Crawl, Walk, Run)
* **Sprint 3:** Provide guidelines for how practitioners can drive carbon optimization culture

## What problem are we trying to solve? 
This working group has the overarching aim to clarify how the established world of FinOps intersects, overlaps and enables the burgeoning world of GreenOps. 

There is no doubt that FinOps savings also equate to potential carbon savings, but the key imperative is to identify how and where these savings exist and to quantify the scale of the savings. 

For FinOps practitioners this will be relevant as it could act as an enabler within their organization to drive remediation and efficiency programmes, to fund additional resources or to simply raise awareness of the need to operate efficient and well structured cloud services

Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities strengthen the greenhouse effect, causing climate change. Most is carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas.. Human-caused emissions have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels

The consequences of inaction risks far reaching impacts to societies, the global economy and the environment - often disproportionately to some of the world’s poorest countries. Despite current trajectories it is argued that staying under the threshold for near irreversible change is still possible, however it requires decisive and cooperative global action to halve emissions by 2030. As stated in the groundbreaking Stern review issued in 2006, There is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, if we take strong action now.

Climate change has increasingly become a political concern as it has become a more dominant voting issue for many citizens and a focus for action at an international level. This is resulting in regulations at national levels that place obligations on organizations and companies to report Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Business is seen as a fundamental part of the solution. 

Many businesses are responding not only to growing customer demands, but also a realization that sustainability is not distinct to business but integral to it. Themes that were previously the concern of fairly marginal Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes are now ingrained into triple bottom line accounting which puts equal emphasis on people and the environment rather than exclusively monetary profit. 

Businesses are reflecting on their purpose to acknowledge that they have a role to reform their internal operations and apply their unique skills and creativity in the innovation of a more sustainable future.

## What are digital emissions?
Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the tech sector are on par or larger than the aviation industry, at around 3% for ICT and 2% for aviation respectively. Within ICT, data centers consume around 1% of greenhouse gas emissions and global electricity usage (equivalent to 200-250 TWh). Industry analysts predict that these emissions will, unless addressed, rise to 10% of global emissions within a decade. 

Currently, most cloud providers only provide basic calculations for energy or carbon emissions from cloud usage to their customers (typically their scope 1 & 2), which can be a challenge for organizations who want to baseline and reduce their carbon footprint across all scopes.

Measuring and understanding the GHG impact is the first step to management and mitigation. Carbon accounting (also known as carbon footprinting) is an exercise to develop an inventory of emissions across an organization, product or service. It typically involves creating a baseline which can be used to assess improvement over time. 

The standards developed by the GHG Protocol are the most widely implemented frameworks for carbon accounting (used by 92% of Fortune 500 companies). Whilst carbon dioxide is the primary GHG emitted globally these methodologies consider other types and families of gases (e.g. methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons), which are measured based on their global warming potential (GWP) in equivalence to carbon dioxide (expressed as CO₂e).

The GHG emissions associated with the ICT sector were estimated at 730 million tonnes CO₂e in 2015. Parallels have been drawn with the aviation industry, which has comparable GHG emissions. Unlike the aviation industry, the nebulous, fragmented, and intangible nature of the internet and digital technologies have meant that these emissions have largely gone under the radar in terms of scrutiny and awareness. There have been substantial efficiencies in data centers in recent years, although this is pitted against ever increasing demand. The complexity of digital has presented challenges to carbon accounting, but the availability of data also presents opportunities that are not available to more traditional industries.

The difference between on-premise data centers and the cloud adds an interesting dynamic to GHG emissions and an organization’s accounting and reporting of it. In one sense cloud technologies simplifies reporting by shifting obligatory Scope 1 (e.g. refrigerant gasses) and Scope 2 (e.g. electricity from the grid) emissions that would be evident for on-premise data centers into Scope 3. However, the omitting of Scope 3 emissions is increasingly inadequate since although there is no direct control over the emissions there may be considerable influence that an organization can take in their reduction or management. 

A challenge for measuring the emissions associated with cloud services is that traditionally the providers have been opaque about key metrics, particularly scope-3, with the big-3 providers all utilizing differing calculation models and providing varying levels of granularity in their data.

## What are scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions?
A core concept to GHG reporting under the GHG Protocol is that of scopes, which differentiate the different classifications of emissions (see EPA definition here):

![The three types of emissions scopes](/img/sustainability/sustainability-1.png)

* **Scope 1 -** Direct GHG emissions (e.g. refrigerant gas emissions from your owned and operated equipment)
* **Scope 2 -** Emissions associated with the generation of electricity, heating/ cooling, or steam which has been purchased for your own consumption (e.g electricity purchased from the national grid for your own data centers)
* **Scope 3 -** a reporting organization’s indirect emissions other than those covered in Scope 2 (e.g. external services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure etc.)

From the cloud consumer perspective, all the hyperscaler emissions fall under the category of your scope-3, but from their perspective, they have their own scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions.

### Why is scope-3 so important?
Scope 3 emissions are less tangible and are often described as ‘tricky’ to truly get a handle on - as exemplified by any movement from on-premise data centers to cloud services. 

Most companies downplay their impact on carbon reporting or consider them out of scope because they are the responsibility of a supplier and/or customer. Increasingly however, companies are expected and recognise the value in reporting these emissions, even if they are unable to quantify them in their entirety

Scope 3 emissions make up a surprisingly high percentage of total emissions for many businesses, often the largest portion of the total. When food giant Kraft mapped out the sources of its own emissions, it found that over 90% of total emissions associated with the company were Scope 3 (Greenhouse Gas Protocol). This isn’t untypical; the best estimates place Scope 3 emissions somewhere between 80% and 97% of total emissions for a large business. 

For a cloud provider Scope 3 emissions are estimated to account for more than 80% of their carbon footprint, with their scope 3 including significant carbon emissions from their core infrastructure and wider supply chain, including the manufacture of data centers, servers, storage, networking etc.

There are a number of benefits associated with measuring Scope 3 emissions. For many companies, the majority of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cost reduction opportunities lie outside their own operations.

So, while many businesses do focus solely on Scope 1 and 2, this means only tackling a small percentage of the emissions linked to your business. Ignoring the emissions in your value chain means that you will never get a grip on your company’s true carbon footprint. It’s a huge missed opportunity.

From an IT perspective, this is particularly true for large consumers of outsourced services such as those delivered by Amazon AWS, Google or Microsoft Azure. By measuring Scope 3 emissions related to external providers, organizations can:

* Assess where the emission hotspots are in their supply chain
* Identify resource and energy risks in their supply chain
* Identify which suppliers are leaders and which are laggards in terms of their sustainability performance
* Identify energy efficiency and cost reduction opportunities in their supply chain
* Engage suppliers and assist them to implement sustainability initiatives
* Improve the energy efficiency of their products

| **Activity data**                        | An activity is any action that creates emissions. It's essentially anything that your company does, uses, or benefits from that generates greenhouse gas emissions. Activity data is the quantifiable measurement of that activity. Example: 341 kilowatt-hours (kWh).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Anthropogenic**                        | Made by people or resulting from human activities. Usually used in the context of emissions that are produced as a result of human activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Avoided emissions**                    | The measurable quantity of emissions that a company intentionally avoids generating as a result of choosing a different activity or changing a process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Baseload power**                       | A long term, continuous, and reliable power supply, often supplied by hydroelectricity, coal or nuclear power. It is a stumbling block for many forms of renewable energy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e)**     | A metric used to compare the emissions from greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential (GWP). Carbon dioxide equivalents are commonly expressed as "million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMTCO2Eq)." The carbon dioxide equivalent for a gas is derived by multiplying the tons of the gas by the associated GWP. MMTCO2Eq = (million metric tons of a gas) * (GWP of the gas)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Carbon Footprint**                     | A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, place or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Carbon Intensity**                     | This is defined as “The amount of carbon by weight emitted per unit of energy consumed”. When we talk about the carbon intensity of electricity, we are referring to the number of grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) that it takes to make one unit of electricity a kilowatt per hour (kW/hour). When electricity is generated using coal power stations, the carbon intensity value is high as CO2 is produced as part of the power generation process. Renewable forms of generation such as hydro or solar produce almost no emissions, so their carbon intensity is very low. The lower the carbon intensity, the greener the electricity. |
| **Carbon insets**                       | Carbon insetting is an investment by an organisation in emissions reductions projects within the company’s value chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Science-Based Targets Initiative**     | The initiative defines and promotes best practice in emissions reductions and targets aligned with specific temperature goals (1.5˚C or well below 2˚C of global warming). It is a widespread mechanism for corporate emissions targets to align to and an allocation approach is taken to attribute global or sector specific emissions to individual companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Scope**                                | The [Greenhouse Gas Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/) has organized all sources of emissions into three types ("scopes") for standard data collection, measurement, and reporting purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Scope 1 emissions**                   | All direct emissions from fuel consumption under their control, for example, gas consumed in boilers, or petrol consumed in owned vehicles. From a cloud provider perspective, this is the emissions from combustion of diesel fuel and the use of refrigerants for cooling data centres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Scope 2 emissions**                   | Emissions from indirect energy consumption. This is usually electricity but can also include purchased heat and steam.
