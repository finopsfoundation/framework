</div>

### Keynotes:
### #1 Dealing with Data Transfer

Based on a lively [conversation in Slack](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/CNJPGNMMJ/p1627071180232200) started by Josh Bauman (EA), we’ve assembled a panel of FinOps experts from heavy streamers to discuss the ins/outs of data transfer cost management. This roster includes: Anders Hagman (Spotify), Teresa Meade (Electronic Arts), and others.

### #2 Adopting FinOps: Getting Organizational Buy-In

Chair Member Ashley Hromatko and Tech Lead Mike Eisenstein are back to present an updated executive buy-in deck for building a FinOps practice that the working group has been tackling. They will also unveil the new FinOps Framework poster that gives a one-page overview of the core tenants of the practice with Vas Markanastasakis. Also hear from Melvin Brown (US Gov OPM) and Natalie Daley (HSBC) on their stories and follow-along in [#wg-adopting-finops](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/C026T4HQK09).

### #3 Waste Reduction: Mountains vs Molehills

Borrowing from Joseph Daly’s post on the topic, we're opening up a conversation about how to tackle and prioritize the tiny inefficiencies of cloud (molehills) vs. the optimization opportunities that can transform value (mountains). Panelists include Andrew Brixton (Citrix), Melissa Lorton and Michael Kerns (Virtasant), Scott Meyer (Spotify), and Teresa Meade (EA) sharing their tales on tackling waste. Check out slack threads in [#aws](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/CNJPGNMMJ/p1627552385245600) and [#azure](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/CNJPJ3YDA/p1627552311081500) on this topic.
